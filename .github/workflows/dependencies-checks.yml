name: DEPENDENCIES-CHECKS
# The role of dependencies checks is to run on schedule and rebuild the environment with the latest available
# dependencies. This way, if either internal or external (3rd party like networkx) dependency break the functionality
# we will be notified quickly. These checks should also test other supported python distributions, to minimise
# resources utilisation the PR-/MAIN-CHECKS will only run on default python distribution.
# The default cadence of this test is once a week. For more sensitive packages, this can be upped to twice a week or daily.
