# Changelog

## NEXT

- Fixed `repr` bug in the `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph` class.
- Added equality method for the `cai_causal_graph.graph_components.TimeSeriesNode` class.
- Extended unit tests for `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph` and
  `cai_causal_graph.graph_components.TimeSeriesNode` classes.
- Added `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.to_numpy_by_lag` method to convert the
  `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph` to a dictionary of adjacency matrices where the
  keys are the time lags with the values being the adjacency matrices with respect to the variables.
- Fixed edge type in the `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.extend_gragh` method.
- Changed the `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.extend_gragh` method to work with
  a non-negative `backward_steps` and `forward_steps` instead of strictly positive.
- Added `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.add_time_edge` method to add a time edge
  between two nodes. This method allows to specify the time lag for source and destination variables. This avoids
  having to create the corresponding node name manually or using the utility function `cai_causal_graph.utils.get_name_with_lag`.
- Changed quickstart to start from a `TimeSeriesCausalGraph` instead of a `CausalGraph`.

## 0.2.0

- Added the `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph` class to represent a time series causal
  graph. `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph` is aware of the time relationships between
  the nodes in the graph while `cai_causal_graph.causal_graph.CausalGraph` is not. Moreover, the
  `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph` class has three new representations:
  - The minimal graph, which can be obtained via the
    `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.get_minimal_graph` method, defines the graph with
    the minimal number of nodes and edges that is required to capture all the information encoded in the original graph.
    This is because a time series causal graph may contain a lot repetitive information. For example, if the original
    graph is `x(t-2) -> x(t-1) -> x(t)`, then the minimal graph would be `x(t-1) -> x(t)`. In other words, it is a
    graph that has no edges whose destination is not time 0.
  - The summary graph, which can be obtained via the
    `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.get_summary_graph` method, defines the graph
    collapsed in time so there is a single node per variable. For example, if the original graph is
    `z(t-2) -> x(t) <- y(t) <- y(t-1)` then the summary group would be `z -> x <- y`. Note, it is possible to have
    cycles in the summary graph. For example, a graph with edges `y(t-1) -> x(t)` and `x(t-1) -> y(t)` would have a
    summary graph of `x <-> y`.
  - The extended graph, which can be obtained via the
    `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.extend_graph` method, defines the graph obtained
    by extending backward and forward in time via the arguments `backward_steps` and `forward_steps`, respectively.
    This graph may contain lots of redundant information. For example, if the original graph is `x(t-1) -> x(t)` and
    `backward_steps=2` and `forward_steps=1`, then the extended graph would be `x(t-2) -> x(t-1) -> x(t) -> x(t+1)`.
- The `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph.from_adjacency_matrices` method was added to
  instantiate an instance of `cai_causal_graph.time_series_causal_graph.TimeSeriesCausalGraph` from a dictionary of
  adjacency matrices where the keys are the time lags.
- Added the `cai_causal_graph.graph_components.TimeSeriesNode` class to extend the
  `cai_causal_graph.graph_components.Node` class to represent time information on the node.
  The following properties were added:
  - `variable_name`: The variable name of the time series node. For example, if the identifier of the time series node
    is `'X1 lag(n=1)'`, i.e., it is a lagged version of the variable `'X1'`, then `variable_name` would be `'X1'`.
  - `time_lag`: The time lag of the time series node. For example, if the identifier of the time series node
    is `'X1 lag(n=1)'`, i.e., it is a lagged version of the variable `'X1'`, then `time_lag` would be `-1`.
- Renamed `EdgeTypeEnum` to `cai_causal_graph.type_definitions.EdgeType`.

## 0.1.3

- Fixed a syntax error in the docstring for the `cai_causal_graph.causal_graph.CausalGraph.get_bidirected_edges`
  method that was preventing the reference docs from being built.

## 0.1.2

- Improved `README` links so images appear on PyPI.
- Upgraded `poetry` version from `1.2.2` to `1.4.2` in the GitHub workflows.

## 0.1.1

- Added security linting checks of source code using `bandit`.
- Improved documentation packaging and publishing.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release of the `cai-causal-graph` package with the `cai_causal_graph.causal_graph.CausalGraph` class and
  component classes: `cai_causal_graph.causal_graph.Skeleton`, `cai_causal_graph.graph_components.Node`, and
  `cai_causal_graph.graph_components.Edge`.
